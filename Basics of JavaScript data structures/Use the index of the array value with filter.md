Let us look at an example which requires us to know the index of the value when using the `filter` function on an array.

You are provided the daily unique visitors to your webpage. The value at 0 index is the count for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, 2 for Wednesday, ..., 6 for Sunday.

This time-series data can now be filtered in various ways. Put another way you can find out how many visitors arrived at your webpage over the weekend etc.
