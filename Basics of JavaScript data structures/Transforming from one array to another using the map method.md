You can apply a function to an array of values to produce a new array. This function will be applied to each value in the input array. The resulting array will contain the same number of items as the input array. The item at index 0 will be the result of applying the function on the item at index 0 of the input array.

The array function which does this is called `map`. 

The functionality of `map` can be simulated using `forEach`. In the section on array iteration we used `forEach` to generate a list of HTML elements. Using the `map` function is easier than doing the same using `forEach`.

Let us first learn how to use `map` function on an array of values. You will see that most of what you learned about the functioning of the `forEach` function applies here for `map` as well.
