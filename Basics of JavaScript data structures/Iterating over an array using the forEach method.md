Information is often represented as a collection of values. In JavaScript this neatly maps to an array of values. 

So far you've learned how to apply a function to a single value to either return a result or perform a side-effect like logging to the browsers console. 

When you have an array of values the function can be repeatedly applied to every value in that array. This is known as iterating over an array of values. 

You will learn about the `forEach` method for iterating over an array of values.
