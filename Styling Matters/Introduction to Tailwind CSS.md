# Intro to Tailwind

In this course, we're not going into detail about everything that you can do with CSS.

CSS is a very large and complex topic that deserves a separate course of its own.

So, instead of learning more about _traditional_ CSS, we're going to quickly jump over to using a _framework_. Developers often use _frameworks_ or _libraries_ to make their job easier, and **Tailwind** is one such CSS framework.

As we've mentioned in the video, one of things that a CSS library like Tailwind does is to _reset_ the base styles of all elements on the page to a safe default.

If you would like to learn more about why such a CSS reset is required, we recommend reading the article [Reboot, Resets, and Reasoning](https://css-tricks.com/reboot-resets-reasoning/), authored by Chris Coyier.
