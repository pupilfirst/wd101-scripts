JavaScript with the <script> Tag

The `<script>` tag is used to embed client-side script (JavaScript) into HTML pages.

The `<script>` element either contains the script itself, or it points to an external script file using the `src` property.

Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.
