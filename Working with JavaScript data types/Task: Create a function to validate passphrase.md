## What is a passphrase

A passphrase is a sentence-like string of words used for authentication that is longer than a traditional password, easy to remember, and difficult to crack. Typical passwords range from 8-16 characters on average, while passphrases can reach up to 100 characters in length.

Here is a short read on the differences between passwords and passphrases and why the latter is preferred these days: https://www.passworddragon.com/password-vs-passphrase

## Validate a passphrase

Now that you have an idea of what a passphrase is all about, let's get into what is expected of you to complete this small task.

You need to complete a function that validates whether a supplied string is a valid passphrase or not satisfying certain conditions. 

We will be covering functions in-depth in the upcoming levels. But here is what functions are basically under the hood - Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. 

In this task, you will be tested on your knowledge in concepts covered so far like strings, variables, arrays, boolean values, etc.

Here is the list of conditions to be met for completing this function in the task:

1. The passphrase should have a minimum of four words.
2. Each word in the passphrase should have more than one character. 
4. The function should return a boolean value - true if the supplied string is a valid passphrase and false if it is not.

We have attached a skeleton JS file with this lesson. You are expected to just complete the empty function `isValidPassphrase` so that it _returns_ the expected value.

## Important instructions

1. Download the JS file which is the template for completing this task.
2. Fill in the code exactly where it is commented. Do not modify any other parts of the file.
3. Follow the instructions and other examples that are given in the template file, as you are yet to be introduced to functions. The intend of the task is just to test your understanding of various aspects covered so far in the course.


Download the file above and complete the function `isValidPassphrase` with the conditions mentioned above. 

> **Important:** This file contains detailed instructions on how to complete this task. Go through all the comments in the file.

Once you're done with the task, save and upload the file in the _Submit_ tab of this module.

Good luck with the task! Have fun! :)
