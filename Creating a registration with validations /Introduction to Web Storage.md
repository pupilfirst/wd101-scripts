Web Storage provides mechanisms to store key-value pairs in a much more intuitive way than using cookies. Traditionally cookies are used to save data in the client side. But cookies have a storage limit of 4Â KB. Cookies also get sent with every request to the server. 

With HTML5, web storage was introduced. The data stored using Web Storage APIs are never sent to the server. APIs or Application Programming Interface is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.

There are two different Web Storage APIs available:

## 1. sessionStorage

- The values are stored only for the duration of page session. Page session is the duration through which the tab or window remains open.

- Maximum of 5 MB can be stored.

#### Basic Usage

```js
// Save data to sessionStorage
sessionStorage.setItem("name", "John Doe");

// Get saved data from sessionStorage
let name = sessionStorage.getItem("name");

// Remove saved data from sessionStorage
sessionStorage.removeItem("name");

// Remove all saved data from sessionStorage
sessionStorage.clear();
```

## 2. localStorage

- localStorage is similar to sessionStorage, but it doesn't have an expiry.
- Data stored in localStorage is never sent to the server.
- Data is shared between all tabs and windows from the same origin.

#### Basic Usage

```js
// Save data to localStorage
localStorage.setItem("themePreference", "Dark");

// Get saved data from localStorage
const themePreference = localStorage.getItem("themePreference");

// Remove saved data from localStorage
localStorage.removeItem("themePreference");

// Remove all saved data from localStorage
localStorage.clear();
```
