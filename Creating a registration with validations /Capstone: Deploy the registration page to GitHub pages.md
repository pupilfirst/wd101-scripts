**To complete this course**: Host the registration form that we demonstrated in this level using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) (we have show you exactly how to use GitHub Pages in the [lesson](https://www.pupilfirst.school/targets/19268)). 
You'll need to make one additional change to the registration form (details below), host it online, and then share its link with us.

## What you need to do

1. Your registration form must have all the functionality demonstrated in this level, including loading of saved data from web storage.

2. **Add additional validations** to the date input field so that it accepts date of birth for people between ages 18 and 55 only. You'll need to figure out how to do this.

3. Host your website on GitHub Pages, and share the link to a hosted version of your website. The [lesson under Resources](https://www.pupilfirst.school/targets/19268) details the steps involved in doing so.

## Please ensure that...

1. ...your website is live, and accessible.
2. ...the link you share shows the registration `form` along with the `table` element. The table should be empty when we first visit the webpage.
3. The `table` element's header should contain the following columns with the exact text: `Name`, `Email`, `Password`, `Dob`, and `Accepted terms?`.
4. ...the `input` elements must have the `id` values demonstrated in this level. i.e., `name`, `email`, `password`, and `dob`.
5. ...there must be an `<input>` element with `type="checkbox"`.
6. ...there must be a `<button>` with `type="submit"`.

Your submission will be reviewed automatically using a test script. The conditions mentioned above should be followed exactly to ensure that these tests can identify and interact with your webpage.

## Use GitHub Pages to host your website

For this final assignment, we require that you use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Go through the lesson "[How to deploy your registration page to GitHub pages](https://www.pupilfirst.school/targets/19268)", follow the instructions there to learn how you can host your Capstone project using GitHub.

> **What's this git & GitHub stuff?**\
> You might be wondering what this git & GitHub stuff is all about. We'll cover this in detail in the WD201 course, but for now we want to get you ready for it by having you sign up for GitHub, and creating a simple _repository_ there.

## The `index.html` and `index.js` files are important

Your GitHub repository containing the capstone project should hold at least these two files - `index.html` and `index.js`. Without these two files in your GitHub repository, your submission will not be accepted.

## Do not plagiarize

Your submission towards this capstone assignment will be subject to a plagiarism check. This check can take some time to complete, and based on the results of this check, your submission's acceptance may be changed. You will be notified by email if any discrepancy is noticed as a result of the plagiarism check.
