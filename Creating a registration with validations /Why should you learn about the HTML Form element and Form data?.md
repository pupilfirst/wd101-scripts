# HTML Forms: Enhancing User Interaction

HTML forms are a powerful tool for web interaction. They serve two primary functions:

* **Data Collection**: Forms gather user data, commonly seen in registration or login forms for services like Gmail or Facebook.

* **User Interaction**: Forms are the main point of interaction between users and web applications. They enable data input, which can be sent for processing or used to update applications instantly.

**Form Components:**
HTML forms include various controls like text fields, dropdowns, buttons, checkboxes, and radio buttons. These controls are usually created using the <input> element.

**Enhancing User Experience:**
Forms can enforce data formats and values through validation and can also provide text labels for accessibility. Understanding how to use and customize forms is essential for creating user-friendly web experiences.
