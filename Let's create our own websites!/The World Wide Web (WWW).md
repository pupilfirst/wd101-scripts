## The Web

The World Wide Web is commonly shortened to _WWW_, or simply called _the Web_. 

A broader definition comes from the organization that Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee helped found, the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/).

> The World Wide Web is the universe of network-accessible information, an embodiment of human knowledge.

In simple terms, the World Wide Web is a network of public webpages connected to one another so that information is exchanged between computers on the Internet.

> **Note:** The _Internet_ and the _Web_ are different things: The _Web_ uses the _Internet_ to pass through information.

## Webpage

A _webpage_ is a document on the World Wide Web, created using HTML, that can be viewed in a web browser.

To access a webpage you can either:

- Type its URL, like `http://google.com` in your Web browser...
- ...or click on a link, like [this one](http://google.com).

> **What's a website?**\
> A _webpage_ is a single HTML document. A collection of such documents, usually linked to each other under the same domain is called a _website_.

## Web browser

A web browser, or simply _browser_ is an application used to access websites. 

Popular web browsers include Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

> In this course, we're using _Google Chrome_ in all of our video demonstrations. You can [install Google Chrome by visiting this link](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/chrome/).
