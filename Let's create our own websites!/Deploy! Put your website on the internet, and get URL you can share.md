Once you make a website, it is no fun if it just sits in your computer and no one else can see it.

So, in this tutorial we'll see how to upload it to the internet and get a URL through which anyone in the world can access it!

Watch the tutorial, and then submit the URL to your webpage hosted on Glitch. We'll try to visit it, and check to make sure that it's accessible. Submitting a link here will let you move onto the next level.
