Every website you see on the internet is made with HTML tags just like the ones you learned before.

And you can actually see their sources!


There are a few ways to access Google Chrome Inspect Element:

- Right-click anywhere on the webpage, and at the very bottom of the menu that pops up, you will see _Inspect_. Click that.
- Click the hamburger menu (the icon with 3 stacked dots) on the far right of your Google Chrome toolbar, click *More Tools*, then select *Developer Tools*. Alternately, in the file menu, click *View > Developer > Developer Tools*.
- Prefer keyboard shortcuts? Press `⌘+⌥+I` on macOS, or `F12` on Windows to open *Inspect Elements* without clicking anything.
