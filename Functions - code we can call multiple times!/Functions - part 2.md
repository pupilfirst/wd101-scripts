We will work on a longer example which is written in the procedural manner and **refactor** it to use small functions.

When we **refactor** code the structure of the code changes. We do not change the functionality or the existing behaviour of the code. 

Programmers refactor the code they've written often to make it easier to read, understand, and modify by themselves in the future, and also to make it easier for other people to work with the same code.
