## Convert name to initials.

Now that you have a good idea of Javascript functions, let's test what you have learned by attempting a small task to write a function. 

The function should basically take an input name(a string) and convert the same to initials, for e.g John Doe to JD. 

Here are few conditions to be met:

1. A single-worded name must return the first two letters of the word as initials. Eg. John should have an initial JO
2. A two-worded name must return the first letter of each of the words in the name. Eg. John Doe should have an initial JD
3. A name with more words should return the starting letter of the first and the last word as initial. Eg. John Doe Honai should have an initial JH
4. The function should return all initials in uppercase.

We have attached a skeleton JS file with this lesson. You are expected to just complete the empty function `createInitialsFromName` so that it _returns_ the expected value.

## Important instructions

1. Changing the name of the function will lead to the rejection of your submitted code.
2. Make sure you `return` the initials string from the function - do not print it to the console.
3. Do not remove the `module.exports = ...` line when submitting your JS file. That line is required for automated tests to work properly.
4. You may need to comment out the `module.exports = ...` line to run the JS file in the browser, but don't forget to restore it before uploading the file here.

Download the file above and complete the function `createInitialsFromName` with the conditions mentioned above. 

Once you're done, save your changes, and upload the file in the _Complete_ tab of this lesson.

Good luck with the task! Have fun! :)
