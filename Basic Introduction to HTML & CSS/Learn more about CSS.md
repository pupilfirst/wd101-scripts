# More about CSS

Are you interested to learn more about what you've seen in the previous lesson? Want to learn how to write custom CSS of your own?

Unfortunately, we don't have the time to dig deeper into CSS in _this_ course. However, we think that the best way to learn CSS is by _experimenting_ with it.

If you want a structured way to learn the traditional way of writing CSS, one of your best options is to follow along with [a tutorial like the one offered by w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp).

## Some suggestions

1. Follow along for the first few chapters, try things out in your web page.
2. Don't feel pressured to complete such tutorials - CSS is a _vast_ topic.
3. Skim through some of the options that CSS gives you - play around with some CSS properties.
4. Look at websites that you like and try to build elements that look similar. This might seem difficult at first - use tutorials to learn more about specific properties that'll help you achieve the look that you want.

Finally, don't rush. As we've mentioned before, CSS is complex topic - give yourself plenty of time to absorb all of the tools that it offers.
