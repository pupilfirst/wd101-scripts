# Enhancing Web Design with CSS:

In our recent lessons, you've gained an understanding of what HTML is and how it's used to structure documents. However, you may have noticed that the documents we created looked quite basic when viewed in web browsers. Headings appeared larger than regular text, paragraphs had spacing and line breaks, and links were colored and underlined to stand out.

## Unleashing Creative Possibilities:

The web would indeed be a boring place if all websites adhered to this basic appearance. This is where Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) come into play. With CSS, you have the power to finely control how HTML elements are presented in the browser, allowing for creativity and customization.

## Exploring CSS:

In the upcoming lessons, we'll delve deeper into the world of CSS. You'll learn how to style HTML elements, apply colors, adjust layouts, and create visually appealing web pages. CSS empowers web developers and designers to transform the look and feel of web content, making each website unique and engaging.
