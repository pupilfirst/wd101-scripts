# How to get help

While you're going through this course, you might encounter situations where you get stuck for some reason.

1. Maybe you have some doubt about a topic that we've just discussed.
2. Maybe you're having trouble setting up your developer environment.
3. Maybe you're having trouble executing some command or some piece of code.
4. Or maybe you have doubts about some related topic that we _haven't_ covered in this course.
5. It really could be anything.

If you have a question, please don't hesitate to ask.

One of the main advantages of being a student in this course is that you can get help from experts easily.

## Two parts: where & how

So let's make it clear how you can get help in two parts:

First, _where_ to ask questions, and second, _how_ to ask questions.

## Where: Pupilfirst School Discord Server

Let's start with the first part - where to ask questions.

> Show the Pupilfirst School Discord Server impersonating the _Verified_ user role.

The _Pupilfirst School Discord Server_ is the place to go if you need a coach or a teaching assistant to answer any question you have. You should already be a member of the Discord community; if you're accessing this course as an enrolled student, you would have been asked to join Discord prior to accessing course material.

In the Discord server, `wd-forum` is where you should go to ask questions. This channel is great for asking longer, more detailed questions, and to get answers from coaches, or from your peers in a more organized manner.

`wd-chat` is an open text-chat area where you can have a quick conversation with others about web development. `wd-chat` can also be useful for getting your doubts answered, but if your question is complex, and might require several back and forth messages with others, we suggest using `wd-forum` instead. When in doubt about where to post, put your question in `wd-forum`.

## How to ask questions

Onto the second part of the video - how to ask for help.

When asking questions, the main thing you want to make sure is to provide as much information as possible. We'll cover this topic in more detail in WD201 - the next course, but for now, I'll give you a few examples. If you encountered an error while trying to run a program, you should definitely share the exact error message and the command that you ran to get the error. If there are any extra logs, share those as well. Sometimes if the problem is visual in nature, screenshots also help. If you're trying to diagnose a specific section of code, share that section of code, and describe what's going wrong. In general, there's no such thing as _too much_ information when diagnosing issues, more is almost always better.

## Interacting with the community means following CoC

Finally, when asking or answering questions or generally interacting with other people in the community, or in the Discord, please make sure you abide by the community guidelines - a link to the same will be provided below this video. Let's try to make sure that everbody feels welcome in asking and answering questions.

We're looking forward to seeing your queries. Bye for now!
