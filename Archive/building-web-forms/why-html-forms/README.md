Forms in HTML are a very powerful tool for interacting with the users â€” most commonly they are used for collecting data, or allowing users to control a web application.

HTML forms are required when you want to collect some data from the person who visits your website. For example, when you register/login for applications like Gmail, Netflix, or Facebook, you enter information like Name, Email, and Password through HTML forms.

HTML forms are one of the main points of interaction between a user and a website or application. Forms allow users to enter data, which is generally sent to a web server for processing and storage, or used on the front end to immediately update the web application in some way (e.g., add another item to a list, or show or hide a feature).

An HTML form is made up of one or more form controls to help structure the overall form. The controls can be single or multi-line text fields, dropdown boxes, buttons, checkboxes, or radio buttons, and are mostly created using the `input` element, although there are some other elements to learn about too.

Form controls can also be programmed to enforce specific formats or values to be entered through form validation. They can be paired with text labels that describe their purpose to both sighted and visually impaired users.
