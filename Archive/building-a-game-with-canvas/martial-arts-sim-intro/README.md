> **Target title**: Martial Arts Sim - Intro

# Script

Now that we've completed a quick introduction to canvas, let's try to use canvas to build something that's a bit more complicated.

Let's try and build a game, or at least a part of a game.

What you're looking at is a martial arts simulator. We've got a martial artist standing in an idle position waiting for commands to be issued. If we click one of the buttons on the page, or press the key on the keyboard corresponding to that action, then the martial artist will execute that action.

Now making an application like this isn't trivial, and it's usually best to build something like this in stages. In the next couple of lessons, we're going to build this game, this simulator in a series of steps.

1. We'll start by load an external image and placing it on the canvas.
2. We'll then move onto loading all the images required for such an animation, and then playing that animation.
3. We'll then figure out how to load all the animations required for an application like this.
4. Finally, we'll implement the control scheme required to let the user control which animations to play, and in what order.

We'll get started in the next lesson.
