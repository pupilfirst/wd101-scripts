In the last couple of lessons, we created what is known as a _static_ website.

```html
<h1 style="background-color: chartreuse;">
  This is my first webpage, and its title.
</h1>

<h2>This is my second heading.</h2>

<p>This is my paragraph.</p>

<img style="width: 600px" src="backwaters.jpg" alt="A scenic backwater image" />

<h2>A story about the time when I visited a backwaters.</h2>

<p>Last year, I visited a backwater, before everything changed.</p>

<p>Last year, I visited a backwater, before everything changed.</p>
```

It's _static_ because it displays the same content for every user. Regardless of who visits the website, it shows the same thing, and there's no way for a user to interact with this page in order to change something on it.

A _dynamic_ website, on the other hand, is one that can display different content, and can change based on how a user interacts with it. Most websites that you use on a day-to-day basis are dynamic - they let you do things like register on it, buy things online, post comments, upload and share pictures, etc.

Dynamic websites are usually created with a combination of server-side and client-side scripting, and one of the most popular languages used for this purpose is JavaScript.

JavaScript is the most popular language in the world. To get a sense of how popular it is, according to the most recent StackOverflow survey, it's used by two-thirds of all programmers in the world, for one purpose or another.

In the field of web development, Javascript is the scripting language that browsers understand. You can run Javascript in all web browsers. Javascript is also very commonly used on the server, to render web pages, and to build other kinds of applications.

Starting with this level, we're going to introduce you to the very basics of programming using JavaScript. In later levels, we'll start mixing JS with HTML to try to get you comfortable using both at the same time.

So, let's get started with JS!
