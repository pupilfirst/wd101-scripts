As a web developer, you're likely going to spend a lot of time doing things on the command-line. It's gives you quick access to a variety of essential tools.

**However,** when you're starting out, there's a few things - some basics - that you need to get comfortable with. Thankfully, it won't take too much time either.

We'll use [Ubuntu's command-line tutorial for beginners](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners) to quickly run you through some _essential_ knowledge (and a bit of trivia) involving the command-line.

## Good command-lines are built according to a standard

The tutorial linked in this lesson is written from the perspective of a user running Ubuntu as their computer's OS. Thankfully, Ubuntu implements a [POSIX-standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) command-line.

This means that commands that your write in on one POSIX-standard command-line will usually work exactly the same way in another, even if it's not running on a system with a different operating system.

All of the topics covered in the linked tutorial should work the same, regardless of whether you're using a terminal inside the Ubuntu OS, macOS, or Windows' WSL, or any other Linux variant.

## Things to focus on learning

- Navigating the folder structure of your system: `ls`, `cd`.
- Creating and deleting folders: `mkdir`, `rmdir`.
- Creating files using output redirection: `echo`, `cat`
- Viewing and deleting files: `less`, `rm`.
- Moving & renaming files and folders: `mv`, `cp`.
- Piping output from one command to another.
- When it's appropriate to _become_ the root user using the `sudo` command.
- How to view hidden files and folders.
- Using *switches* to modify the actions of commands.
